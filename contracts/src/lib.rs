#![no_std]

//! Escrow contract for issue bounties, with explicit validation boundaries.
//!
//! Every entry point validates its arguments *before* it writes state or calls
//! the token contract, so an invalid request is rejected deterministically with
//! a typed [`BountyError`] and cannot leave a partially applied escrow behind.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! These hold for every state reachable through the public API:
//!
//! 1. **Initialised before use.** `create_bounty` and `release_bounty` require
//!    `FeeRecipient` to exist, and `initialize` is the only writer of it. Before
//!    this boundary existed, a bounty could be opened before `initialize` and
//!    then never released, because `release_bounty` requires a fee recipient.
//! 2. **Amount range.** `1 <= amount <= MAX_BOUNTY_AMOUNT`. The upper bound is
//!    chosen so that the fee arithmetic of invariant 3 can never overflow.
//! 3. **Fee range.** `0 <= protocol_fee_bps < MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS`. The fee is
//!    `amount * protocol_fee_bps / 10_000` (truncating), so `fee <= amount - 1`
//!    and `payout = amount - fee >= 1`: a bounty can never be released while
//!    paying the hunter nothing, and no accepted request can overflow `i128`.
//! 4. **Distinct, live accounts.** `creator`, `hunter` and `token` are pairwise
//!    constrained: `creator != hunter`, and none of them is the contract itself.
//!    Paying the contract would strand the payout with no recipient.
//! 5. **Ids are allocated once.** `NextId` is advanced before the token call and
//!    is never reset, so a re-sent or repeated submission can never overwrite an
//!    existing bounty record. Every stored id is checked to be vacant.
//! 6. **One release per bounty.** `released` is checked, then persisted, before
//!    the payout transfers, so a second release can never move funds twice.
//! 7. **Conservation.** For a released bounty,
//!    `amount == payout + fee` and `payout + fee` leaves the escrow account.
//!    Nothing else debits or credits the escrow account.
